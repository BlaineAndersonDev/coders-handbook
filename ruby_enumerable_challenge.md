# Ruby Enumerable Challenge
> A small Ruby Enumerable worksheet I created to test myself daily for a few weeks, until I have all the common enumerable memorized (or at least committed to memory enough that I can mostly recall how to use them properly).

> I've included a full set of examples above, as well as a few different BLANK worksheets underneath. I recommend Copy Pasting into your local machine, or using [Repl.it](Repl.it) to test each problem.
