    <p class="guide_text">Time to time I find I need or would enjoy a guide to help me figure somthing out, usually something simple.
    It seems like creating a simple codex of common use lines of code, tips and tricks would be something you can find anywhere...</p>
    <p class="guide_text">No. No, finding it is the hard part. Most times the information I'm looking for is buried in a pile of filler for an article, or some small unimportant part is debated on stackoverflow, overshadowing the actual line of code needed for a project.</p>
    <p class="guide_text">Listed below are links to my own personal guides, filled with simple code blocks and minor notes including only pertinant information for the coder looking at it. I add to these guides as required, and have more in the works that are not listed here yet (not enough infomation included to be a whole guide).</p>
    <p class="guide_text">I hope that whoever finds this can use my guides to further their projects or resolve their errors.</p> -->
